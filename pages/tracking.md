Event tracking
==============
MolView tracks a number of actions, like changing the model representation,
using Google Analytics. This way, we can analyze stuff like which functions
are more popular and might require more attention in order to keep improving
the MolView user experience.

You can always disable event tracking by reloading MolView and unchecking
"Allow MolView to track interaction in order to improve the MolView experience"
